# A 3Dmigoto general vb merge and split tool.
Designed for shader hackers, easier to test and debug.

And it can be compatible with many games with minimum modification required.

(This tool is still in public beta test developing)

We use BasiCheck.ini to manually check VertexShader in different games,
because global check is hard to debug and cause FPS decrease problem.

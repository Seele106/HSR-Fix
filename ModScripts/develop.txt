TODO we need a json file to store the information to config
  and use it to pass the draw value
  Merge vb0 files,generate config file,use it to import into blender,modify and export
  Split the output ib and vb file seperatelly,and write draw number in config
  Generate a final .ini file used to load back to game.
TODO need to test with weapon export
    # TODO drawindexed cannot work perfectly! need to use draw xxx,0  xxx is calculated in GIMI's blender script.
    #  we now can make sure that this xxx value is comes from
    #  (the length of position file's bytes / the stride of position file)
    #  Even with the right draw number,the texcoord still cannot draw in the texcoord hash correctly,but GIMI can do this correctly.
    #  very strange,but now we can only use the IB to replace vb1 texcoord.

TODO
  1.需要修复merge脚本输出的文件名part部分重复问题
  2.由于原始的split方法无法正常导入游戏，因此需要使用GIMI的split方法来测试
